# Ricotta Gnocchi

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 pint ricotta
- 4 oz Parmesan, freshy grated
- all-purpose flour, about 1 1/2 cups
- 2 eggs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

### Sauce

- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 can whole tomatoes, crushed by hand
- 3 sprigs basil

## Instructions

1. Use low-moisture ricotta that does not contain any gums or stabilizers. Mix ricotta with eggs, freshly grated Parmesan, a pinch of salt, and just enough flour for the dough to come together. Knead into a single ball
2. Divide dough into 4 equal parts. Roll each section of dough into a thin log, about 3/4 inches thick, then cut into 1/2 inch dumplings. Once shaped, dust with flour to prevent sticking. Bring a large heavily salted pot of water to a boil.
3. Heat a fry pan over medium-high heat, coating bottom of pan with olive oil. Add onions with a pinch of salt until slightly caramelized
4. Add garlic until fragrant, then add crushed tomatoes, seasoning sauce with salt and pepper. Add basil sprigs and reduce sauce
5. Throw gnocchi into boiling water and cook until they float. Pull gnocchi with slotted spoon and toss into the pan of sauce. Once all gnocchi have been pulled, add pasta water to the tomato sauce until slightly looser than the desired consistency
6. Freeze remaining gnocchi on sheet pan for 1 hour, then transfer to a freezer bag. Frozen gnocchi should be cooked without defrosting
