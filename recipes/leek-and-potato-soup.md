- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 stalk green onions, sliced

## Instructions

1. Trim and toss dark green section of leeks. Trim whites and light green section in half lengthwise, then wash throughly and pat dry. Dice leeks
2. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a pot, then add leeks with a pinch of salt. Cook until translucent, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking until leeks are nearly paste-like, about 40 minutes
3. Add cubed potatoes, cover with chicken stock and/or water, and season with salt as needed
4. Cook until potatoes are fork-tender. Reserve some potatoes and leeks as garnish, then blend remaining mixture in batches until smooth.
